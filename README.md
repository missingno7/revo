# revo - Rust 2D Cellular Evolution Library + examples

This repo contains the revo library and example implementations using the library.

Revo is a Rust 2D cellular evolution library designed to provide a simple framework for creating and evolving populations of 2D cellular automata. It provides an implementation of common genetic algorithm components, such as selection, mutation, and crossover, and is highly customizable to accommodate various applications.

- More about revo library can be found in the [revo](https://github.com/missingno7/revo/tree/master/revo) folder.
